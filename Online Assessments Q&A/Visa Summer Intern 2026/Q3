Problem Description
Imagine that your mobile phone is currently out of battery, but you need to use it for t minutes.
You have a number of spare batteries.

Each battery i has:
•	capacity[i] → number of minutes the phone can be used once the battery is fully charged.
•	recharge[i] → number of minutes required to fully recharge that battery after it is depleted.
Rules
•	You start at time t = 0 with the phone connected to battery 0.
•	When a battery gets fully depleted, it immediately starts recharging.
•	You may switch to another battery only if it is fully recharged.
•	If the next battery is still recharging, you must skip it and try the next one cyclically.
•	If at any moment all batteries are recharging, the phone cannot be used anymore.
________________________________________
Goal
Return the number of full batteries used to keep the phone running for exactly t minutes.
If it is not possible to keep the phone running for all t minutes, return -1.
________________________________________
Input
•	t – integer, total minutes you need to use the phone
•	capacity[] – integer array, capacity of each battery
•	recharge[] – integer array, recharge time for each battery
________________________________________
Output
•	An integer representing the number of fully used batteries
•	Return -1 if the phone cannot be kept on for t minutes
________________________________________
Example
Input:
t = 16
capacity = [2, 5, 6]
recharge = [12, 1, 4]

Output:
3
Explanation:
•	Battery 0 used for 2 minutes → recharges until t = 14
•	Battery 1 used for 5 minutes → recharges until t = 8
•	Battery 2 used for 6 minutes → recharges until t = 13
•	Battery 1 becomes available again and is used to finish the remaining time
Total batteries used = 3

Solution:
	import java.util.*;

class Main {

    public static int getBatteryCount(int t,int[] capacity,int[] recharge) {
        if(t==0) return 0;
        int curr_time=0,count=0,last_idx=0;
        int[] next_available = new int[capacity.length];
        Arrays.fill(next_available,0);

        while(curr_time<t) {
            boolean found_battery=false;
            
            for(int i=0;i<capacity.length;i++) {
                if(next_available[i]<=curr_time) {
                    found_battery=true;
                    // last_idx = i;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if(!found_battery) return -1; 

            for(int k=0;k<capacity.length;k++) {
                int idx = (last_idx+1+k)%capacity.length;
                if(next_available[idx]<=curr_time) {
                    curr_time+=capacity[idx];
                    next_available[idx] = curr_time+recharge[idx];
                    last_idx = idx;
                    count++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = sc.nextInt();
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] capacity = new int[n];
        int[] recharge = new int[n];

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            capacity[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }        

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            recharge[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        int res = getBatteryCount(t,capacity,recharge);
        System.out.println(res);
    }
}

/*  
    current_time = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13
    [2+12,7+1,13+4]
    capacity[i] <= time[i-1] ->use the battery
