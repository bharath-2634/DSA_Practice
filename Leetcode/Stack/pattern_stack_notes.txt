Notes:

* A stack is for elements that are waiting for something in the future.

* 1️⃣ Am I comparing elements with others on the left or right?

If yes → potential stack.

2️⃣ Do I need the first greater/smaller, not all of them?

If yes → strong stack signal.

3️⃣ Am I repeatedly scanning the array again and again?

If yes → stack can likely optimize it.

4️⃣ Does an element become “useless” once a better one appears?

If yes → stack is perfect.
